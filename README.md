# Analytics → ML → AI Journey

This repository documents my structured journey from **Data Analytics foundations** to **Machine Learning and Applied AI**.

The focus is on building strong fundamentals, statistical intuition, SQL analytics, and business-driven insights before moving into advanced modeling and AI systems.
