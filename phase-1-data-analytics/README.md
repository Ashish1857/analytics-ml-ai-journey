# Phase 1 – Data Analytics Foundations

This phase focuses on understanding data structure, statistical behavior, and translating analytics into clear, business-driven insights.  
The emphasis is on **data quality, exploratory analysis, and explainable decision-making** before any modeling.

## Topics Covered
- Data inspection and validation
- Descriptive statistics
- Quartile-based segmentation
- Revenue contribution analysis
- Distribution analysis & visualization
- Outlier detection using IQR

## Day 1 – Customer Segmentation & Revenue Analysis
**Focus:** Aggregation, descriptive statistics, and business interpretation

- Customer-level spend aggregation
- Mean vs median analysis
- Quartile-based customer segmentation
- Revenue contribution by segment
- Introductory visualizations

## Day 2 – Exploratory Data Analysis & Data Quality Checks
**Focus:** Data reliability, distribution understanding, and anomaly detection

- Missing values check
- Data type validation and conversion
- Duplicate detection
- Distribution analysis (histograms & KDE)
- Manual binning and labeled categories
- IQR calculation and interpretation
- Boxplot-based outlier detection

## Key Takeaways
- Median is often a better representation of typical behavior in skewed data
- IQR provides a robust way to understand spread and detect anomalies
- High values are not always outliers — context matters
- Visualization validates statistical assumptions

---

## Tools Used
- Python
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
